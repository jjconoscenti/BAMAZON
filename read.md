Welcome to my Bamazon store!

This is a Command Line Interface (CLI) that uses Node.js Sequel Pro. It functions like a regular e-commerce site, where a customer shops for an item, views their cart/checks out, and then the store's stock is dynamically updated.

Instructions: 
* Before using the app, clone this repo to your computer (must have Node.js installed)
* Run "npm install" from your command line to install the npm packages used to create this app

- To start the app, type "node bamazon.js" into your command line
- To shop around for items, choose "Shop" from the main menu
    - To view the items the store carries, scroll up
    - Then, pick the item you'd like to purchase from the list
    - Then, enter how many of that item you'd like to purchase
        - If the item is available, you will see your cart's total
        - If the item isn't available, you'll be notified by an error message and be able to shop for other items
